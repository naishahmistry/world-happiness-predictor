    "We chose the World Happiness Report (WHR) Data Set, and we will be predicting happiness score aka “Life Ladder” as the label. This would be considered a supervised learning problem because we have a distinct label we want to predict: “Life Ladder.” We are going to try to identify which features might influence happiness by using inputs like “Social support,” “Freedom to make life choices,” “Perceptions of corruption,” and more to see which countries may value specific attributes for happiness. This is a regression problem because “Life Ladder” is a continuous numerical value that can change based on various factors. This is neither a binary nor multi-class classification problem because “Life Ladder” is numerical, not categorical. Possible features can be: Country, year, Log GDP per capita, Social support, Health life expectancy at birth, Perceptions of corruption, Generosity, Positive affect, Negative affect, Confidence in national government, Democratic Quality. A company could create value with a model that predicts this label to help employee well-being and employee retention. Let’s say a company is experiencing quick employee turnover and does not understand why particularly, this model can help the company understand what factors are influencing employee happiness (which in turn can affect performance and retention rates). This can largely benefit big companies where it’s hard to gauge emotions of all employees or even HR teams that want to work on expanding their company."
